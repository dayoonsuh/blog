I had tteokguk with my brother today. I was going to season to taste with soy sauce we didn't have it. So, we put a magic powder - ramyeon seasoning.
It worked out pretty well. Thanks to PKA president for giving me leftover tteokguk.

After we were done with lunch, we went to Vienna. My brother had banana nut muffin latte and I just ordered a black coffee with irish cream syrup. I think sugar free syrups have some particular weird taste. But it wasn't too bad. I'll try all the sugar free syrups in Vienna.

Tomorrow, I will have vanilla oatmeal with soy milk for breakfast and apple pie banana smoothie for lunch. What a perfect plan. For dinner, I am seeing Se eun. We are going to go Oishi. I have never tried food at Oishi, so I am kind of excited.

Starting tomorrow, I will do meditation. I need to increase my focus.
