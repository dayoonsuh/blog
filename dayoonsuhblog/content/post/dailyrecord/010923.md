Here we go again. Fall semester started today. Going to classes has been a while, and I feel I get exhausted easily.
I want to sleep. All the pressures have become denser. I slept in two of the classes. Earth science is so boring. And those text books and materials are so expensive. I don't want to spend my money on that class but it is required to purchase the book.
I should manage my time wisely. After living a week, I am going to plan my daily routine. I should routinize my days for time management.
